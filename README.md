# Harden-Runner

Harden-Runner secures CI/CD workflows by controlling network access and monitoring activities on GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners. It blocks unauthorized network traffic and detects unusual activity to protect against potential threats. The name "Harden-Runner" comes from its purpose: strengthening the security of the runners used in GitHub Actions workflows.

## Getting Started

This guide walks you through the steps to set up and use Harden-Runner in your CI/CD workflows.

### **Step 1: Add Harden-Runner to Your Workflow**

To integrate Harden-Runner, follow these steps:

- Open your GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/<workflow-name>.yml`).
- Add the following code as the first step in each job:
   ```yaml
   steps:
     - uses: step-security/harden-runner@446798f8213ac2e75931c1b0769676d927801858 # v2.10.3
       with:
         egress-policy: audit

**Tip**: Automate this step by pasting your workflow into the [StepSecurity online tool](https://app.stepsecurity.io/secureworkflow)

### **Step 2: Access Security Insights**

Run your workflow. Once completed:
- Review the **workflow logs** and the **job markdown summary**.
- Look for a link to **security insights and recommendations**.

- Click on the provided link (e.g., [example link](https://appv2.stepsecurity.io/github/step-security/github-actions-goat/actions/runs/7704454287?jobid=20996777560&tab=network-events)) to access the **Process Monitor View**, which displays:
   - **Network events**: Outbound network calls correlated with each step.
   - **File events**: File writes tracked during the job.
